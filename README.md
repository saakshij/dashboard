The project is academic. It's made to evaluate my level in
native web development languages; test my capacity to build
advanced user interfaces with HTML, CSS and JavaScript only
and learn more things about those technologies. It's a
front-end project only. No any back-end API is called.
The main goal of this project is to reproduce the old
GitLab home page only.
